\title{Evaluate an R expression and interrupts it if it takes too long}

\description{
 Evaluate an R expression and interrupts it if it takes too long.
}

\usage{
withTimeout(expr, substitute=TRUE, envir=parent.frame(), timeout, cpu=timeout,
  elapsed=timeout, onTimeout=c("error", "warning", "silent"), ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{expr}{The R expression to be evaluated.}
  \item{substitute}{If \code{\link[base:logical]{TRUE}}, argument \code{expr} is
   \code{\link[base]{substitute}()}:ed, otherwise not.}
  \item{envir}{The \code{\link[base]{environment}} in which the expression should
    be evaluated.}
  \item{timeout, cpu, elapsed}{A \code{\link[base]{numeric}} specifying the maximum number
    of seconds the expression is allowed to run before being
    interrupted by the timeout.  The \code{cpu} and \code{elapsed}
    arguments can be used to specify whether time should be measured
    in CPU time or in wall time.}
  \item{onTimeout}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} specifying what action to take if
    a timeout event occurs.}
  \item{...}{Not used.}
}

\value{
 Returns the results of the expression evaluated.
 If timed out, \code{\link[base]{NULL}} is returned if \code{onTimeout} was
 \code{"warning"} or \code{"silent"}.
 If \code{"error"} a \code{\link{TimeoutException}} is thrown.
}

\details{
 This method utilizes \code{\link[base]{setTimeLimit}}() by first setting the
 timeout limits, then evaluating the expression that may or may not
 timeout.  The method is guaranteed to reset the timeout limits to be
 infinitely long upon exiting, regardless whether it returns normally
 or preemptively due to a timeout or an error.
}

\section{Non-supported cases}{
 In order to understand when this function works and when it does not,
 it is useful to know that it utilizes R's built-in time-out mechanism,
 which sets the limits on what is possible and not.
 From \code{\link[base]{setTimeLimit}}(), we learn that:

 \emph{"Time limits are checked whenever a user interrupt could occur.
  This will happen frequently in R code and during Sys.sleep(*), but
  only at points in compiled C and Fortran code identified by the
  code author."}

 More precisely, if a function is implemented in native code (e.g. C)
 and the developer of that function does not check for user interrupts,
 then you cannot interrupt that function neither via a user interrupt
 (e.g. Ctrl-C) \emph{nor via the built-in time out mechanism}.
 To change this, you need to contact the developer of that piece of
 code and ask them to check for R user interrupts in their native code.

 Furthermore, it is not possible to interrupt/break out of a "readline"
 prompt (e.g. \code{\link[base]{readline}}() and \code{\link[base]{readLines}}()) using
 timeouts; the timeout exception will not be thrown until after the user
 completes the prompt (i.e. after pressing ENTER).

 System calls via \code{\link[base]{system}}() and \code{system2()} cannot be
 timed out via the above mechanisms.  However, in \R (>= 3.5.0) these
 functions have argument \code{timeout} providing their own independent
 timeout mechanism.

 Other examples of calls that do \emph{not} support timeout are "atomic"
 calls that may take very long such as large object allocation and
 \code{rnorm(n)} where \code{n} is very large.

 (*) Note that on Unix and macOS, \code{Sys.sleep(time)} will signal a
     timeout error only \emph{after} \code{time} seconds passed,
     regardless of \code{timeout} limit (< \code{time}).

  Internally, \code{\link[base]{eval}}() is used to evaluate the expression and
  \code{\link[base]{setTimeLimit}}() is used to control for timeout events.
